    "The 1 and 2 portions of the names come from the curl operation which gives the right-hand side. The $r$ and $l$ represent the right/left faces from reconstruction. This is because, usually, $A_i$ is staggered, while $B$ and $v$ are not. Thus, we require the reconstructed values at the faces. As is standard in this documentation, the staggered variables will be denoted by $\\underline{A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of the relationship between variables, the staggered vector potential component $\\underline{A}_z$ lives at $(i+\\frac{1}{2},j+\\frac{1}{2},k)$. The velocities are generally only known at cell centers, so they must be reconstructed in both the x and y direction to get the value at $(i+\\frac{1}{2},j+\\frac{1}{2},k)$. This leads to the notation for `v1` and `v2`. For a reconstructed $\\underline{A}_z$, `v1rr` is $v^x$ reconstructed at $(i+\\frac{1}{2},j+\\frac{1}{2},k)$, taking the right face of both reconstructions. The returned value is $\\underline{A}_i^\\mathrm{RHS}$. Since the function is direction-agnostic, the value of $i$ is determined by the incoming data, not by anything internal to the function. In addition, the function is unaware of the actual grid structure, so it could also be used to compute $A_i^\\mathrm{RHS}$ if the cell-centered vector potential is being evolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function assumes that a staggered quantity $\\underline{B}^i$ is known which is staggered only in the direction of $i$. For example, $\\underline{B}^x$ is defined at $(i+\\frac{1}{2},j,k)$. The $r$ and $\\ell$ elements are reconstructed quantities for the single reconstruction of the staggered quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $c$ elements (e.g. `c1_min`) are the characteristic speeds for that point. These can be computed using the `calculate_characteristic_speed_dirn` functions (for [x](https://github.com/SamuelCupp/GRHayL_beta/blob/main/GRHayL/Flux_Source/calculate_characteristic_speed_dirn0.c), [y](https://github.com/SamuelCupp/GRHayL_beta/blob/main/GRHayL/Flux_Source/calculate_characteristic_speed_dirn1.c), and [z](https://github.com/SamuelCupp/GRHayL_beta/blob/main/GRHayL/Flux_Source/calculate_characteristic_speed_dirn2.c)) in the `Flux_Source` gem. It is important to calculate these values using the properly reconstructed values. For example, the right and left face values for the `dirn0` characteristic speeds should have been reconstructed in the $x$ direction. This is discussed more in their documentation (TODO: link when created).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the element `psi6` stores the value of the BSSN quantity $\\psi^6 = e^{6\\phi}$ at the staggered point. Since $\\phi$ is naturally cell-centered, this usually requires interpolating to the point before packing the struct."

Since IllinoisGRMHD (which GRHayL inherits code from) reconstructs to $-\\frac{1}{2}$, GRHayL currently also does this. Therefore, we have to increment the reconstructed directions to get the correct face. For the point $(i,j,k)$, the $v$ variables come from the index $(i+1,j+1,k)$. In general, the directions perpendicular to the $i$ of $A_i^\\mathrm{RHS}$ are increased by 1. The $\\underline{B}^x$ variables are from the index $(i,j+1,k)$, and the point of $\\underline{B}^y$ variables are from the point $(i+1,j,k)$. In general, the $B$ variables add 1 to the index $i$ of $\\underline{A}_i^\\mathrm{RHS}$ permuted by 1. Finally, $\\psi^6$ is interpolated to the staggered point.
