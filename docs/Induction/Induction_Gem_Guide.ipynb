These functions are split between those which are naturally computed in a single direction (flux contributions to $A_i^{\\rm RHS}$) and those which are direction-independent ($\\tilde{\\Phi}^{\\rm RHS}$ and gauge contributions to $A_i^{\\rm RHS}$)."

    "To compute the RHS, several considerations have to be made. First, we need to decide if we have staggered variables. Currently, all `GRHayL` functions assume that the vector potential $A_i$ is staggered in the perpendicular directions (i.e. $A_x$ is staggered in the y,z directions and $A_y$ is staggered in the x,z directions). Due to the implementation of the HLL flux, `GRHayL`'s notation also assumes the presence of a $B^i$ staggered in one direction (i.e. $B^x$ is staggered in the x direction and $B^y$ is staggered in the y direction). However, note that since all `GRHayL` functions only take stencils of variables, whether there is actually a grid variable $B_{\\rm stagger}$ is entirely unknown to `GRHayL`, so long as it is able to be passed the expected variables. The scalar potential $\\tilde{\\Phi}$ is fully staggered to $(i+\\frac{1}{2},j+\\frac{1}{2},k+\\frac{1}{2})$. For clarity, we will label any staggered variables using $\\underline{A}$.\n",

The A_no_gauge_vars struct is more complicated than most structs due to the cross-product terms that require different coordinates depending on the component of the RHS being computed. As such, it is highly recommended that users read the [HLL flux](HLL_flux.ipynb) documentation before using. This function requires multiple reconstructions of the velocities to get to the staggered gridpoint of $\\underline{A}_i$, and improperly packing the struct will cause unexpected behavior."

While this function computes all the RHS variables, only the outline of steps for the induction equation will be included here. All reconstructed operations are included, even those only needed for the GRHD RHS functions to make implementation easier. Reconstructed variables will be denoted with an $R$ followed by the coordinates they've been reconstructed in. Note that this implementation reconstructs to $m-\\frac{1}{2}$, while the magnetic components are needed at $m+\\frac{1}{2}$. This leads to additional indexing complications for computing $A_i^{\\rm RHS}$. As this choice is inherited from IlliniosGRMHD, we leave it as is until an example code implements a simpler version of this process.\n",

    "<a name=\"cspeed_note\"></a>1. [^](#cspeed_ref) Note that the characteristic speeds are not actually at the same point. We could calculate these values at the correct location by computing the characteristic speeds using the doubly reconstructed velocities. However, this would introduce many more loops over the `calculate_characteristic_speed_dirn*` functions since we need these $c^i$ for the GRHD RHS calculations anyways. In addition, we would either need to introduce more grid functions or reconstruct the velocities repeatedly to get everything we need for every RHS calculation. However, the usage of the misaligned $c^i$ matches that of [Del Zanna, Bucciantini & Londrillo](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210618) (labeled as $\\alpha^{\\pm}$). Yuk Tung Liu discussed this point with M. Shibata, who found that the effect of this offset is negligible."
