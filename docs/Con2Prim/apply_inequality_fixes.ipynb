    "For a given set of primitive variables $\\left\\{\\rho_{b},P,v^i,B^i\\right\\}$ in the physical range (i.e. $\\rho_{b}\\geq0$, $P\\geq0$ and $\\epsilon\\geq0$), the corresponding conservative variables $\\left\\{\\rho_{\\star},\\tilde{\\tau},\\tilde{S}_{i},\\tilde{B}^{i}\\right\\}$ must satisfy certain inequalities (see appendix A of [Etienne *et al.* (2012)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.0568v4) for the full discussion). Here we provide a practical recipe to impose these inequalities approximately to reduce inversion failures, which occur mainly in regions with very low density in the artificial “atmosphere” or inside the BH horizon where high accuracy is difficult to maintain but not crucial. This function is designed for use with the hybrid equation of state, but it does not directly rely on any hybrid-specific features."

Since auxiliary quantities are used, we recommend use either `GRHayL_enforce_detgtij_and_initialize_metric` or `initialize_metric` to automatically compute these quantities from the ADM quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primitive quantities used from `prims` are the magnetic quantities (`Bx`, `By`, `Bz`).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Additionally, `diagnostics->failure_checker` stores information about which inequalities were violated. Each digit of `failure_checker` represents a different condition in the Con2Prim gem, so the individual failures are simply added to the variable. If `tau` is reset, then $10^6$ is added to `failure_checker`. If the momentum is rescaled, then a factor is added to `failure_checker` depending on the failure condition. The first condition adds $10^7$, and the second condition adds $10^8$."
