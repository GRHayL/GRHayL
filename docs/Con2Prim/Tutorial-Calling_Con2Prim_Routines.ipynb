    "GRHayL provides a variety of conservative-to-primitive (C2P) algorithms. These can be directly used, and the `Hybrid_Select_Method` function provides the ability to switch between C2P methods at runtime. The `Hybrid_Multi_Method` function uses `Hybrid_Select_Method` and allows for up to 3 C2P methods to serve as backup methods if the preceeding methods fail."

    "First, let's look at the argument list which is shared by all conservative-to-primitive routines:\n",

    "```\n",
    "int Hybrid_Multi_Method(\n",
    "      const GRHayL_parameters *restrict params,\n",
    "      const eos_parameters *restrict eos,\n",
    "      const metric_quantities *restrict metric,\n",

    "```\n",
    "The first two arguments appear in most GRHayL functions and contain information on the simulation and equation-of-state parameters. The next struct contains (pointwise) information on the metric. Whenever packing the metric struct, we recommend using the function `GRHayL_enforce_detgtij_and_initialize_metric`, which also enforces that the determinant of the conformal metric equals one. GRHayL functions may behave unpredictably with abnormal metrics, as they have not been tested as rigorously outside the expected input ranges. The conservative_quantities input contains the **undensitized** conservative variables. Since evolving densitized variables is quite common, we provide the `undensitize_conservatives` function (TODO: link) which takes a struct containing densitized variables and packs a new struct with undensitized quantities to serve as input for this function. The final input is the primitive_quantities struct `prims`, which must at least contain the $B^i$ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputted primitives are packed into the primitive_quantities struct `prims_guess`, which is also used as temporary storage for the initial guess for the method. If the parameter `params->calc_prim_guess` is true, then `prims_guess` is set by the `guess_primitives` function. Otherwise, the initial guess is set to whatever was provided via the `prims` input. The $B^i$ in `prims_guess` are always set equal to the $B^i$ in `prims`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These arguments are identical for all the C2P routines, so switching between individual routine functions is very simple."
