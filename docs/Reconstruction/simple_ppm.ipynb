    "`rho`, `pressure`, and `var_data` contain stencils for $\\rho_b$, $P$, and the other variables to be reconstructed. The stencil length is 6 because the function reconstructs the left and right faces, each of which requires 5 points. `var_data` is a 2D array containing stencils for all the other variables to be reconstructed. The first array argument will loop from 0 to `num_vars`, so the passed array should have dimensions `var_data[num_vars][6]`. `v_flux_dirn` is the velocity $v^i$ in the direction of the reconstruction. For example, the quantity $v^x$ would be passed to reconstruct in the $x$ direction. Finally, `Gamma_eff` is the effective gamma for the reconstruction. This is computed in `IllinoisGRMHD` with\n",

    "In addition to `ppm`, we also provide the `ppm_no_rho_P` function. This function is nearly identical to `ppm`, but it does not reconstruct the baryonic density or pressure. We choose to provide two functions to avoid having many `if` statements within the functions. For example, the function `steepen_rhor_rhol` is only called if $\\rho_b$ is being reconstructed, so including $\\rho_b$ in the `var_data` array would require another argument to tell the code which index contained $\\rho_b$ and a check on every reconstruction at every point whether the variable being reconstructed is $\\rho_b$. Similarly, $P$ is required regardless of whether it is being reconstructed or not, as it is needed to compute $\\tilde{f}$. We could add $P$ to `var_data` whenever we actually want to reconstruct it, but that would be duplicating the stencils. For these reasons, we provide two different functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary use for this function is reconstructing variables that will get overwritten during the `ppm`. For example, reconstructing the velocities $\\left(v^R\\right)^L$ and $\\left(v^R\\right)^R$ can cause a race condition with the reconstruction of $v^R$ from $v$. If the $v^R$ computed from $v$ is copied into a temporary variable which serves as input for reconstructing $\\left(v^R\\right)^L$ and $\\left(v^R\\right)^R$, there would not be a conflict. However, that is a lot of duplicated memory, so many codes use $v^R$ as both output and input.\n",

The first array argument will loop from 0 to `num_vars`, so the passed array should have dimensions `var_data[num_vars][6]`. The stencil length is 6 because each reconstruction requires 5 points, and we are reconstructing both the left and right faces. `v_flux_dirn` is the velocity $v$ in the direction of the reconstruction. I.e., the quantity $v^x$ would be passed to reconstruct in the $x$ direction. Finally, `Gamma_eff` is the effective gamma for the reconstruction. This is computed in `IllinoisGRMHD` with\n",
