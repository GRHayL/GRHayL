Note          : Most code in the first release version of GRHayL is adapted
                from IllinoisGRMHD, which is itself based on the GRMHD code
                of the Illinois Numerical Relativity group, written by Matt
                Duez, Yuk Tung Liu, and Branson Stephens (original version),
                and then developed primarily by Zachariah Etienne, Yuk Tung
                Liu, and Vasileios Paschalidis.

==========
1. Purpose
==========

GRHayLib provides the features of the General Relativistic Hydrodynamic Library (GRHayL)
in the Cactus framework. GRHayL is an infrastructure-agnostic magnetohydrodynamics
code library designed for modular development of GRMHD code. The library is divided
into independent modules, or "gems", which provide various features needed for GRMHD
simulations.

The core GRHayL "chalice" provides core connective tissue in the form of C structs
and very simple functions that act only on these structs. Adding onto GRHayL_Core
are several gems which provide specific features. These currently include Atmosphere,
Con2Prim, EOS, Flux_Source, Induction, Radiation, and Reconstruction. Each gem
implements infrastructure-agnostic functions for computing quantities for GRMHD
simulations.

=========================
1. Additional Information
=========================

This thorn only provides the core library features and initializes the GRHayL
parameter and EOS structs that are used throughout the simulation. To see thorns
which use GRHayLib for simple initial data, see the GRHayLID and GRHayLIDX thorns.
For GRMHD evolution, see IllinoisGRMHD, GRHayLHD, or GRHayLHDX.

Also, please note that GRHayLib currently only provides the functions on the host
for CarpetX simulations. Work to provide access to the library functions on both
host and device is currently ongoing.
