If you choose to include a preliminaries section, enumerate it with the \"0.\" All other sections, subsections, and sub-subsections can be enumerated with the 1. Jupyter/LaTex will handle their own numbering/lettering scheme. It is important when creating subsections and sub-subsections that you indent as seen in the Markdown code.

    "\n",
    "The Table of Contents is a family of internal links. To link internally we first have to specify an ***anchor tag*** which is the text within the parentheses of preceded by a # (See ToC Markdown code). For instance, the anchor tag for this subsection is `internal_links`. So, for a particular Step within the Table of Contents you specify the Step title in brackets (e.g., <font color='blue'>[Step 1.a]</font>), appended by the anchor tag in parentheses preceded by a # (e.g., <font color='red'>(#internal_links)</font>), followed by a \":\" and the Step description (e.g., : Internal linking with the Jupyter notebook, Table of Contents). Look at the Markdown code for the Table of Contents for a few examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: The anchor tags cannot be anything that you want. Anchor tags must be entirely lowercase and contain no spaces. Numbers are fine as well as underscores, but not capitalization. I suggest making the anchor tags have significant meaning to the section there tied to, instead of making one that reads \"step1a\". The reason I say this is because if you ever need to resection your module, the tags won't all need to be changed as well if you give each one a unique name.  \n",
    "\n",
    "All we have done so far is establish anchor tags and clickable links within the Table of Contents, but how do we establish the link to the specific section within the module? Opening up the Markdown code for this section you will see a line of code above the title, and a line of code directly below the title. These are the answers to the question. Each section requires these components to be included for both the Jupyter notebook and LaTex internal linking. Make sure the top line of the Markdown code has a space between it and the title. Similarly, the code directly beneath the title needs  space below it as well, separated from the main body of text (see above in Markdown code).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: Links do not work unless the two sections which are linked have been run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Table of Contents is now linked to this section, and you may have already noticed that this section, and all others, are linked back to the Table of Contents using the Markdown code in line at the end of the section title. This is exceedingly convenient for modules of great length. It may also be convenient when you're in a particular subsection and you wish to just return to the header section. This is accomplished using a bracket parentheses \\[\\]() pairing like so (see this in Markdown code). Go back to [Step 1](#linking).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you would more often than not write a code block below implementing what was discussed in this section. This isn't always necessary, some header sections plainly serve as a set up for subsections that will contain all of the necessary coding components.  "
