    "The reason for making these fields strings is that when setting\n",

So, `create_test` looks for the existence of `success.txt`. If it exists, we delete it and create_test has finished for the current function and moves on to the next function.

What this algorithm does in essence is factor out common subexpressions (i.e. `a**2`) by storing them in their own variables (i.e. `x0 = a**2`) so that any time `a**2` shows up, we don't have to recalculate the value of the subexpression; we instead just replace it with `x0`. This is a seemingly small optimization, but as NRPy expressions can become massive, the small efficiencies add up and make the calculation orders of magnitude faster.\n",
