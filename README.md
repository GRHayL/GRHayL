# Con2Prim_beta
This is a beta version of the infrastructure-agnostic conservative-to-primitive code my collaborators and I are developing. It is designed to simply take structs populated with the (point-wise) primitive and conservative data, perform c2p routines, and return the structs with the reconstructed data.
