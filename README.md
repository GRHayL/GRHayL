The General Relativistic Hydrodynamic Library (GRHayL) is an infrastructure-agnostic
magnetohydrodynamics code library designed for modular development of GRMHD code.
The library is divided into independent modules, or "gems", which provide various
features needed for GRMHD simulations.

The core GRHayL "chalice" provides core connective tissue in the form of C structs
and very simple functions that act only on these structs. Adding onto GRHayL_Core are
several gems which provide specific features. These currently include Atmosphere, Con2Prim,
EOS, Flux_Source, Induction, Neutrinos, and Reconstruction. Each gem implements
infrastructure-agnostic functions for computing quantities for GRMHD simulations.

More information about the details of the library functions are provided in the
[online wiki](https://github.com/GRHayL/GRHayL/wiki).

## Building and Installing `GRHayL`

`GRHayL` includes a `configure` script which sets up a Makefile. For a full list of options,
use the `-h` option for a list of all compilation flags.

### Dependencies

`GRHayL` contains an optional `HDF5` dependency, and the default configuration builds with `HDF5`
active. To compile without `HDF5` use the `--nohdf5` flag. To compile `HDF5` on your local machine
use the command

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev
```

`GRHayL` is also actively tested on MacOS using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
package manager. To install `HDF5` on MacOS we recommend using

```shell
$ brew install hdf5
```

We have not tested `GRHayL` with [macports](https://www.macports.org/), although
we do not expect users to have issues when using it.

The `HDF5` dependency arises from the tabulated Equation of State (EOS) gem, as
it currently only supports EOS tables in that format. We are also
working supporting tables in the [CompOSE](https://compose.obspm.fr/table)
format, which would allow for use of the tabulated EOS without `HDF5`.

### System-wide Installation (default)

As an example, suppose you wish to install `GRHayL` on your system using
`gcc`. To do so, run the following commands:

```shell
$ CC=gcc ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```

### Local Installation

As an example, a local installation that uses the next-generation intel
compilers is achieved as follows:

```shell
$ CC=icx ./configure --prefix=<local_path>
$ make
$ make install
```

## CI Testing

`GRHayL` uses Github Actions to perform continuous integration (CI) testing for validating the code.
The Unit_Tests directory contains the unit tests which are used for the CI. The subdirectory
"data_gen" contains the functions for generating the test data. The actual test data is kept in
the [Test_Data](https://github.com/GRHayL/Test_Data) repository. Tests with "ET_Legacy" in the name
only generate input data, as the output is generated from the `GRHayLTestPatch` branch of `IllinoisGRMHD`
in the `Einstein Toolkit` for validation with the old code. All the tests function by generating
output data and perturbed output data. The perturbed data is generated by perturbing the input data by

perturbed input = input X (1 + 1e-14).

This output serves as error bars for the functions, and the tests validate that the computed output falls
within this range.

## Implementations

Most codes will simply link to the compiled library. However, some infrastructures (such as
the `Einstein Toolkit`) interface with the library more easily by directly compiling the code.
The implementations directory contains specific implementations of `GRHayL` in infrastructures
that prefer this method of interfacing with `GRHayL`.
